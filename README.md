# Website

**Version 1.0.0**

This is my first website that I wrote using JavaScript. 
This is only the front-end of an interactive website that is dynamic.

The website is divided into couple of sections; the JavaScript file, pokem.js,is where the magic happens. 
The pok.css file had very few designing because this website is mainly for practicing JavaScript and make the website more interactive.
Laslty, I used the Bulma css framework for the ping pong game in the middle of the page, just to make it look nicer
